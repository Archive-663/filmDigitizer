### Story Time:
I know we don't need another filmm digitizer setup but I wanted to make my own where I didn't have to always fiddle with making sure the camera was completely parallel with the film plane. This one is a simple setup, focus, white balnce, aperture priority, scan away. It's currently a work in progress but it works enough for me. The film hangers are dual use; used for hanging and weight to keep the roll taut while drying. They come with the option of printing what ever size hook suits your home dev setup.
