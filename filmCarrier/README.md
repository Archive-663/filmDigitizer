### What youâ€™ll need:
- 4x M3 x 20mm machine screws (PETG) or self tapping screws (PETG or ABS)
- 4x M3 x 8mm machine screws (PETG) or self tapping screws (PETG or ABS)
- 3x M3 x 6mm machine screws (PETG) or self tapping screws (PETG or ABS)
- 2x M3 x 6mm set screw
- 1x 1/4-20 x 1/2" button head screw for Raleno LED Panel Clamp

### What would be helpful:
- M2.5 or M2.6 drill for the M3 screws.
- M3 tap

### Printing help:
I print with PETG because it's pretty easy to set up with and dial in. If you want to use something else, go for it. I'd stay away from PLA because it's not the best in heat and against solvents. 

Generally, all my designs have chamfers on the print face of the STL.

Please view the printOrientation.3mf file for help with orienting the parts on the printer bed. 

### Assembly help:
I suggest drilling holds to their correct tap size before tapping. The M3 holes should be drilled out to 2.5mm then tapped with the M3 tap. The Rotator holes should be drilled out with an m2 or m1.8 drill bit.

Please view the _assembly.stp file for help in parts orientation. If you do not have a CAD program, <a href="https://www.freecad.org/downloads.php" target="_blank">download FreeCAD</a> to view the assembly file and better understand how it should assemble.
